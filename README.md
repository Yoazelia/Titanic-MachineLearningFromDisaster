# Kaggle Competition: Titanic Survival Prediction

## Introduction

The Titanic Survival Prediction project is based on the infamous sinking of the RMS Titanic during its maiden voyage in 1912. This Kaggle competition challenged participants to build a predictive model answering the critical question: "What sorts of people were more likely to survive?" The tragic event resulted in the loss of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew due to a shortage of lifeboats.

## Objectives

The primary goal of this project was to leverage machine learning techniques to analyze passenger data and develop a model capable of predicting the likelihood of survival for individual passengers. By exploring correlations and patterns in the dataset, I aimed to gain insights into the factors that influenced survival rates during this historic disaster.

## Dataset

The dataset provides information on various aspects of each passenger, including their name, age, gender, socio-economic class, and more. By leveraging this data, participants can explore correlations and patterns that may indicate which groups of people were more likely to survive this historic disaster. The dataset can be found here:
